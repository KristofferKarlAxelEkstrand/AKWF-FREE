AKWF or Adventure Kid Waveforms is a collection of one cycle waveforms
to be used within synthesizers or other kinds of sound generators. It
is basically the smallest sound possible to sample and still get the
overall feel of the sampled instrument.

## Versions

### AKWF (Original)

The waveforms are 600 samples long, chosen during my early work on
an additive synth in high school. That length worked well for
layering octaves, while shorter cycles degraded the sound. I hadn’t
yet learned about standard buffer sizes like 256 or 1024—this was
just my starting point.

If use it as a sample and treat it as a C ad you pitch it pitch it
to D1+2 you get an actual C... yeah... I know...
