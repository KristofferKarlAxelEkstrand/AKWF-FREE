Adventure Kid Research & Technology (AKRT)

While making music I have always try what happens
if I miss use something and try to find things
through experimenting - I love both old technology
and new. Through the years I have sampled a lot of
stuff, programmed my own synthesizers and effects 
and tried a lot of techniques. Adventure Kid
Research & Technology is my way of both collecting
and sharing what I make and find.
